**Scrape the results of this housing search**
I extracted **Price , House details(number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, square footage,) and Addresses**
```{r}
getPrice <- function(html){ 
  html %>% html_nodes('.list-card-price') %>% html_text() %>% str_trim()
}
getDetails <- function(html){ 
  html %>% html_nodes('.list-card-details') %>% html_text() %>% str_trim()
}
getAddress <- function(html){ 
  html %>% html_nodes('.list-card-addr') %>% html_text() %>% str_trim()
}

rawData = NULL
for (i in 1:3){
  price <- getPrice(all_pages[[i]])
  details <-  getDetails(all_pages[[i]])
  address <-  getAddress(all_pages[[i]])
  rawData <-  rbind(rawData, data.frame(cbind(price, details, address)))
}

```
**Do some cleaning**

```{r}
df1 <- rawData %>%
  mutate(bedrooms = as.integer(str_trim(str_extract(details, "[\\d ]*(?=bds)")))) %>%
  mutate(bathrooms = as.integer(str_trim(str_extract(details, "[\\d ]*(?=ba)")))) %>%
  mutate(sqft = str_trim(str_extract(details, "[\\d ,]*(?=sqft)"))) %>%
  mutate(sqft = as.numeric(str_replace(sqft,",",""))) %>%
  mutate(price = as.numeric(str_replace_all(price,"[^0-9]*","")))
df1 <- na.omit(df1)
#str(df1)
df2 <- as.data.frame(df1)
head(df2)
```
**Here is a  plot of Square footage vs. price**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g1 <- ggplot(df2, aes(x=sqft, y=price, size=sqft, color=as.factor(bedrooms))) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Price ($)",
       x = "Square footage (squared feet)",
       title = "Square footage vs. Price of houses Athens GA")
g1
```
We see a positive relationship between square footage and price. 


**Histogram showing Number of bathroom in the house**
```{r}
countbaths <- ggplot(data=df2, aes(bathrooms)) + geom_histogram()+
                labs(title="Histogram for Bathrooms") +
                    labs(x="number of bathrooms", y="Count")
countbaths
```
**Regression analysis and goodness of fit**
```{r}
#model 1
linear_model <- lm(price ~ bedrooms + sqft + bathrooms, data = df2)
linear_model$coefficients
summary(linear_model)
```
On average, having an additional bedroom decreases the price by $157541 and this result is significant at the 5% level

On average, having an additional bathroom increases the price by $22539 but this result is not signifcant.
The R-squared for this model is 77 percent. 
**What elements should be considered in this model to increase the fit?**
For a better fitted model, we would need data for variables like the air-pollution, number of nearby schools, recreational centres, hospitals, crime rate etc.

```{r}
#model 2
#non-linear 
nonlinear_model <- lm(log(price)~log(bedrooms)+log(sqft), data=df2)
summary(nonlinear_model)
nonlinear_model$coefficients
```
